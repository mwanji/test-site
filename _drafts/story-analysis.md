Ramit Sethi has a great article called ["How to tell killer stories"](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-tell-killer-stories). I have been applying similar principles, within the context of looking for a job, by helping a friend develop what Ramit calls the Story Toolbox. In the process, I came up with a number of questions that are useful in analysing the quality of a given story.

## Is there a narrative?

Meaning, is it actually a story? Does it have a beginning, middle and end? Does it progress through an arc? Is there [a hero who encounters obstacles and overcomes them](http://jodyhedlund.blogspot.com/2012/08/obstacles-in-stories-3-ways-to-turn.html)? By employing literary story-telling techniques, you can make your story clearer and more engrossing.

## Are there concrete details?

Injects personality. Draws the listener in by making it easier for them to project themselves into what you're talking about. Pick the right details: remarkable or surprising rather than mundanes, that give a concrete expression of the larger point you're making. These details can set the scene ("My office was on the 20th floor and every morning as I walked in, I couldn't help but pause to admire the view of the city")

## Is jargon appropriate?

When telling a story related to your field of expertise, it is easy to slip into jargon. Jargon is basically vocabulary that experts understand that non-experts don't. Jargon is powerful when used with someone who understands it, because it communicates to them that you are both members of the same group and speak the same language. If used with someone who doesn't understand it, they will feel alienated and perhaps lost. If you determine that your interviewer does not understand the jargon of your field, you need to unpack it into understandable terms and examples.

For example, "I worked in a multi-discplinary group using multi-dimensional research methods" is jargony and vague. "I worked alongside sociologists, economists and anthropologists and conducted in-person interviews, developed surveys and did statistical analysis" is much more concrete and understandable by the layperson.

## Who can you tell it to?

The reason you need to have a full Story Toolbox is because every story isn't appropriate for every interview. The stories you choose to tell might depend on the sector the job is in, your relationship with the interviewer, how much time you have left or which topics pop randomly into the conversation. If the interview is going well, you might choose to tell a longer story that reveals something interesting about your personality. At the beginning of a more formal interview, you might stick to shorter stories that focus on skills and expertise.

## Is it modular?

You can approach telling a story in the same way a jazz musician approaches improvisation. By knowing the material inside and out, you can decide on the fly which parts to change, emphasise or leave out altogether. Just as different stories appeal to different audiences, each story can be adapted to best suit the listener. To prepare for this, you can mark certain paragraphs or details as optional, and only bring them up when they are most effective.

Imagine you have a story about how you combined your tech skills with your passion for dog walking. When interviewing for a tech-focused job you would focus on the tech skills you employed. If you were interviewing for a dog walking job, you might emphasize how you became passionate about walking dogs.

## How many ways can the story start?

This also makes it easier to start telling a story. Think about a story's potential entry points. When an interviewer asks about a time you demonstrated leadership, you can draw an anecdote from a wider story and launch the story from there. This allows you to take more control of the conversation and make more of an impression.

## Does it sound good out loud?

While you write out the story, remember that it is meant to be said, rather than read. It needs to sound good. Pacing, intonation and other oral story-telling techniques are just as important as the literary techniques in making sure that the story works. [Body language](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-read-body-language-and-improve-your-own/) and even something as simple as smiling can make a big difference. Actually telling the story out loud to yourself, filming it and telling it to someone else are great ways to really know the material and how to deliver it.
