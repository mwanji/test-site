og_description=Can a terrible soap opera really be a valuable learning tool?
~~~~~~

This might be definitive proof that even the worst soap operas can be turned into something useful.

In 2001 I moved to Brussels, Belgium, to a one-bedroom appartment. It was so close to the Anderlecht Football Club's stadium that we could hear cheering after a goal.

We didn't have cable TV. We just had a basic antenna on top of the TV, which limited us to a small handful of channels. At the time, my girlfriend was obsessed with Days of our Lives, to the point that she'd record the show on VHS tapes when medical school forced her to miss it.

It was on the main public Flemish TV station, so it was in English with Dutch subtitles. My girlfriend is Flemish, so even though you can live in Brussels just fine without speaking Flemish, I spent a fair amount of time in Flanders, in a Flemish-speaking environment. Also, because I'm such a loving partner, I'd watch the show with her, but desperately needed to find something more interesting than Stefano Dimera's latest schemes. So I forced myself to study the subtitles so I could learn something. Because of DooL's limited plot ideas and vocabulary, the same words came up very often, making it easy to figure out.

The TV station abruptly cancelled DooL about a year later, but it really helped my Dutch.
