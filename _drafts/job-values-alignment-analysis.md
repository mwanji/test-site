og_description=An exercise to help you define what matters to you in a job
~~~~~~

When looking for a job, you don't want to take a "spray and pray" approach, where you send out hundreds of CVs and hope for a positive answer. 
- demoralising
- low probability of success
- low probability of getting the place you really want

Instead, you can invest much more time and effort into the handful of places you really want to work. But how do you know where you want to work? One step is to see what values are important to you. Doing this gives you clarity and easily eliminates the vast majority of employers. It also gives you a motivation and sense of why you're investing heavily into the opportunities you've selected.

This exercise is about thinking about some of the tradeoffs you are willing to make. No job is perfect all the time, so, when pushed, what are you ready to give up on? What **really** matters to you?

## Personal values

### Mission

How important is it for you to personally believe in what the company is doing?

### Education

Is it important for you to learn a lot from the job?

### Work-life balance

Is it OK for your job to take away the time and energy you might otherwise have spent on hobbies or going out with friends?

### Workplace ambiance

Do you need to get along well with your colleagues? Do you want to go out for drinks with them?

### Salary

Are you prepared to accept a lower salary?

### Social status

Do you need to be proud to announce your job title to people? Or is it OK to be a little embarassed?

### Autonomy
### Future prospects

How heavily do you weigh the importance of future job conditions being better than the current ones? For example, would you accept a lower salary today if you thought there was a reasonable chance of significant raises in a year or two?

## Company characteristics

Size
Organisation: established company with procedures and fairly routine jobs, or less-defined, whatever-is-needed, unpredictable dayss
Formality: hierarchy, suit or t-shirt
Risk: will this company/job be around in 5 years?

## How to know if a job matches your values

Factual aspects can be found online, Linkedin, Crunchbase, Glassdoor for example
Talk to existing employees
Prepare questions for interviewer
